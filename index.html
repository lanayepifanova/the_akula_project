    <!-- Vikram Akula Bio -->
<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-purple-800 mb-6 text-center">Who is Vikram Akula?</h2>
<p class="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-center max-w-3xl mx-auto">
  Vikram Akula is a globally recognized social entrepreneur, best known for pioneering large-scale microfinance initiatives aimed at empowering economically marginalized communities.
  <br><br>
  In 1997, he founded Swayam Krishi Sangam (SKS) in India as a non-profit organization to provide microloans to poor women. Realizing the challenges of scaling non-profit operations, Akula transitioned SKS into a for-profit entity in 2005. This move allowed SKS Microfinance to attract greater investment and expand its reach dramatically — disbursing over $5 billion in loans and serving more than 7 million active borrowers by 2010–11. SKS Microfinance went public in 2010, with its IPO oversubscribed 14 times, marking a major milestone in the microfinance sector.
  <br><br>
  After stepping down from SKS in 2011, Akula continued his mission of financial inclusion by founding Vaya Finserv in 2014, an organization that uses tablet-based technology to deliver loans to underserved populations in India. Beyond Vaya, he has been an active angel investor in social impact ventures such as ArthImpact, a fintech platform offering app-based credit to small entrepreneurs, and AgSri, a venture that supports sustainable farming practices across Africa and India.
  <br><br>
  Akula’s dedication to social development extends into education as well. He founded the Bodhi School in India to provide high-quality education to underprivileged children, further reinforcing his belief in opportunity as a catalyst for change.
  <br><br>
  Educated at Tufts University, Yale University, and the University of Chicago, Akula has been recognized by TIME Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. His life's work embodies resilience, innovation, and a relentless commitment to creating pathways out of poverty.
  <br><br>
  Fittingly, "Akula" also means "shark" in Russian — a symbol of strength, perseverance, and forward momentum, which reflects the values and aspirations of The Akula Project.
